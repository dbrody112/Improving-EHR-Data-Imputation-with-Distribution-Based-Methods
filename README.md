# Improving-EHR-Data-Imputation-with-Distribution-Based-Methods

This algorithm will be improving data imputation (filling in missing values with realistic
values that match the data) in Electronic Health Records (EHRs) to improve any secondary use
of EHR data. The idea to improve imputation is to use a distribution-based method. Through
experimentation the method has shown to work consistently across datasets, showcasing the role
that distributions have on the method of imputation.
